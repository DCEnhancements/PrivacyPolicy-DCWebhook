# Privacy Policy

**DC Enhancements** built the **DC Webhook** app as a utility tool for sending webhooks to Discord. This SERVICE is provided by **DC Enhancements** and is intended for use as is.

This page informs visitors regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information.

---

## Information Collection and Use

The **DC Webhook** app may collect limited information through third-party services integrated into the app. This includes data necessary for analytics and advertising, such as:

- Device type  
- Operating system  
- General location (city-level)  
- App usage data (e.g., session duration, screen views)

This data helps us improve the app and serve relevant ads, but it does not include personally identifiable information like your name or email.

---

## Data Transmission

When using the DC Webhook app, the information you choose to send (such as messages, usernames, avatars, attachments, embeds, or polls) is transmitted directly to Discord via your provided webhook URL.

We do **not** store, monitor, or intercept this data in any way.

---

## Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

The DC Webhook app integrates third-party services including:

- **Google AdMob** â€“ for displaying ads  
- **Google Firebase** â€“ for analytics, crash reporting, and performance monitoring

These services may collect certain data as described in their respective privacy policies. We do **not** share any user-generated content (such as webhook messages) with third parties.

For more information, please review the privacy policies of these services:

- [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)  
- [AdMob Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543)

## Ads and In-App Purchases

The **DC Webhook** app contains advertisements served by Google AdMob. Ads help support the development and maintenance of the app. There are currently **no in-app purchases**.

---

## Security

We prioritize user privacy by design. Although some analytics and ad-related data may be collected via third-party services, we do **not** collect or store user-generated webhook content on our servers.

Since webhooks are URLs tied to your Discord account or server, we recommend safeguarding your webhook URLs appropriately.

---

## Cookies

The app does **not** use cookies directly. However, third-party services (e.g., AdMob or Firebase) may use cookies or similar technologies as part of their functionality.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

This Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe that a child has used the app inappropriately or has submitted data, please contact us immediately.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the app after such changes are made will signify your acceptance of the updated policy.
