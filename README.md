**Privacy Policy**

DC Enhancements built the DC Webhook app as a utility tool for sending webhooks to Discord. This SERVICE is provided by DC Enhancements at no cost and is intended for use as is, with support for ads and optional in-app purchases.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information.

### **Information Collection and Use**
The DC Webhook app does not require users to provide personally identifiable information. However, it may collect certain technical data necessary for functionality, advertising, and analytics.

#### **Data Collected Automatically**
While using our Service, certain data may be collected automatically by third-party services, including:
- Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID for personalized ads)
- Device model and operating system version
- App interaction data (e.g., feature usage, error reports)
- Log data such as IP address, timestamps, and crash reports

### **Third-Party Services and Data Sharing**
The app integrates with third-party services, which may collect and process user data as outlined in their respective privacy policies. These include:
- **Google Play Services** ([Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/))
- **AdMob** (for in-app advertising) ([Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en))

We do not store, sell, or share personally identifiable user data, but third-party SDKs may process data for ad personalization and analytics.

### **Ads and In-App Purchases**
The DC Webhook app is monetized through advertisements and in-app purchases. Ads may be personalized based on collected device data unless users opt out of personalized advertising through their device settings. In-app purchases are processed securely through the respective app store, and we do not have access to payment details.

### **Security**
We prioritize user privacy and employ industry-standard security measures to protect collected data. However, as no online service is entirely secure, users are encouraged to take precautions, such as reviewing permissions and managing privacy settings.

### **Cookies**
The app does not use cookies directly, but third-party services integrated within the app may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to enhance user experience and serve personalized ads.

### **Childrenâ€™s Privacy**
This Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If a parent or guardian believes their child has provided personal information, they should contact us for immediate removal.

### **Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any significant changes will be posted within the app and/or on our website. Continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

This policy is effective as of 2024-02-20.
