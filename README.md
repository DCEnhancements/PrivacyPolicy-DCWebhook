DC Enhancements built the DC Webhook app as a utility tool for sending webhooks to Discord. This SERVICE is provided by DC Enhancements at no cost and is intended for use as is, with support for ads and optional in-app purchases.

### **Information Collection and Use**
The DC Webhook app does not require users to provide any personally identifiable information. It functions solely as a tool to facilitate the sending of webhooks to Discord as per the user’s configuration. No user data is stored, transmitted, or shared by our servers.

The app does not utilize third-party services to collect user information.

### **Ads and In-App Purchases**
The DC Webhook app may display advertisements provided by third-party ad networks. These ads may collect limited information such as device identifiers to provide relevant advertising content. Additionally, the app may offer in-app purchases to unlock premium features. Any purchase-related information is processed securely through the respective app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store), and we do not collect or store any payment details.

### **Log Data**
While using our Service, in case of an error or crash, minimal diagnostic data may be collected through third-party services such as Google Play Services. This may include device-specific information such as:

This information is used solely for debugging and improving the app experience and is not linked to any personally identifiable user data.
