Privacy Policy
DC Enhancements built the DC Webhook app as a utility tool for sending webhooks to Discord. This SERVICE is provided by DC Enhancements at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information.

Information Collection and Use
The DC Webhook app does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information or device data.

The app's sole purpose is to allow users to send content via Discord webhooks to Discord's servers.

Data Transmission
When using the DC Webhook app, the information you choose to send (such as messages, usernames, avatars, attachments, embeds, or polls) is transmitted directly to Discord via your provided webhook URL.
We do not store, monitor, or intercept this data in any way.

Third-Party Services and Data Sharing
The DC Webhook app does not integrate any third-party services, such as analytics, advertising networks, or external SDKs.
There are:

No ads

No tracking

No third-party data sharing

However, data sent through the webhook is processed by Discord according to their own Privacy Policy.

Ads and In-App Purchases
The DC Webhook app contains no advertisements and no in-app purchases. It is fully free to use without any monetization.

Security
We prioritize user privacy by design. Since the app does not collect user data, there is no user data to protect on our servers.
However, as webhooks are URLs tied to your Discord account or server, we recommend safeguarding your webhook URLs appropriately.

Cookies
The app does not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy
This Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or request data from children. If you believe that a child has used the app improperly, please contact us immediately.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be communicated through an updated version of this page. Continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

This policy is effective as of 2024-02-20.
